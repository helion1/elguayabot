# ElGuayabot

Simple yet Guayaba. Telegram Bot for my friends. Check it out at [@elguayabot](https://t.me/elguayabot).

ElGuayabot is developed in netcore using domain driven design and clean code. Please take that into account when contributing.

# Warning

This bot was made thinking about a lot of inside jokes between a group of friends, it's content may result offensive to some, but it's never the intention. May contain mature language.
